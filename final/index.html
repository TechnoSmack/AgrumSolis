                        <p>Located in the northeastern part of Puglia, our farm sits in the renowned Brindisi Plain, characterized by predominantly flat, fertile, and well-drained agricultural land. This unique geographic position provides the ideal Mediterranean climate for citrus cultivation.</p>
                        
                        <p>The region's agricultural distribution reflects its exceptional growing conditions, with cereals covering 29% of the agricultural area, olive cultivation at 27%, temporary forage crops at 17%, and citrus farming maintaining a significant presence throughout the landscape.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our traditional orchards, many approximately 70 years old, feature picturesque landscapes with orange and lemon groves that have been carefully maintained as part of Italy's significant citrus production network. Many of our trees are grafted onto bitter orange rootstocks, following time-honored Mediterranean agricultural practices.</p>
